  "Regardless of the situation, regardless of the scoreboard, you're going to be successful because you've put in all the time, all the effort, all the hard work, and you know that it's going to pay off.",
  "Don't ever let somebody tell you that you can't do something. Not even me, alright? You got a dream, you gotta protect it. People can't do something themselves, they want to tell you you can't do it. If you want something, go get it. Period.",
  "I've found that nothing in life is worthwhile unless you take risks. Fall forward. Every failed experiment is one step closer to success. You've got to take risks. You will fail at some point in your life. Accept it. You will lose.Never be discouraged. Never look back. Give everything you've got.",
  "I learned many great lessons from my father, not the least of which is that you can fail at what you don't want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.",
  "You cannot let a fear of failure or a fear of comparison or a fear of judgment stop you from doing the things that will make you great. You cannot succeed without the risk of failure. You cannot have a voice without the risk of criticism.",
  "Be present. I would encourage you with all my heart just to be present. Be present and open to the moment that is unfolding before you because, ultimately, your life is made up of moments. So don't miss them by being lost in the past or anticipating the future.",
  "I encourage you to live with life. Be courageous, adventurous. Give us a tomorrow, more than we deserve. The most important thing in your life is to live your life with integrity and not give into peer pressure to try to be something that you're not.",
  "Don't be afraid of fear. Because it sharpens you, it challenges you, it makes you stronger; and when you run away from fear, you also run away from the opportunity to be your best possible self.",
  "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Sometimes you find out what you are supposed to be doing by doing the things you are not supposed to do.",
  "To me, being perfect is not about that scoreboard out there. It's not about winning. It's about you and your relationship to yourself and your family and your friends.",
  "I know if I am going to have any life anymore, it is because I am still willing to fight and die for that inch, because that is what living is. The six inches in front of your face.",
  "It's easy to be positive when everything is working out. It's much harder, much much harder when nothing is working out. But that's when we need it the most...Everything is worth the prize.",
